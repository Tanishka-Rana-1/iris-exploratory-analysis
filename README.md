# 🌼 IRIS INTELLECT – My First Data Analysis + ML Project

> “Every flower blooms at its own pace.”  
And so did my learning — one plot, one insight, one line of code at a time.

## 👩‍💻 About This Project

As part of the **Angaar Batch Summer Training** under **Lovely Professional University (LPU)**, I took my first leap into the world of **data analytics**. This project is my beginner-friendly yet insight-packed analysis of the famous **Iris dataset** — and also my very first **machine learning classification model**! 💻📊🌸

## 🧭 Journey Through the Petals

I didn’t just run code. I asked questions like:
- Do petals and sepals tell a species apart?
- Which feature contributes the most to classification?
- Can I build a model that correctly guesses the flower species?

This project is a mix of:
- 📊 Vibrant Visuals
- 📈 Real Interpretations
- 🤖 Simple but smart ML
- 💡 Lessons that I’ll carry into my next projects

## 📂 What’s Inside?

📁 Iris-Intellect
├── Iris.csv                  # The dataset of all 3 flower species

🎨 Visual Explorations
I went all out with Seaborn & Matplotlib to paint the story in plots:

🌺 Countplot – Confirmed class balance (50 of each species)

💫 Pairplot – Revealed Setosa as the clear outlier

📦 Box & Violin Plots – Uncovered spread, outliers, symmetry

🎯 Heatmap – Proved Petal Length/Width are best predictors

📚 Subplots & KDEs – Multi-angle feature view

📈 Accuracy Curve – Tuned the k value in KNN

Each graph was a step in uncovering nature’s design through data.

🤖 Machine Learning – My First Attempt!
I used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
Here’s what I did:

Cleaned outliers using IQR 🧹

Encoded species with LabelEncoder

Trained with 80/20 split

Tested accuracy with k = 3, 5, and 9

Plotted how accuracy changes with each k

🔍 Best Accuracy Achieved: ~96%
🎓 Most Predictive Features: Petal Length & Width

🔧 Tech Stack
Tool / Library	Role
pandas	Data manipulation
seaborn	Stylish visualizations
matplotlib	Plotting foundation
scikit-learn	Machine learning & metrics
numpy	Numerical operations

✨ What I Learned
The magic of meaningful plots 🎨

The importance of cleaning data before trusting it

That even a simple KNN model can classify with high accuracy

And most importantly — patience and curiosity go a long way in data science

❤️ Special Thanks
To the professors and mentor , especially under the Angaar Batch, for making data feel less like numbers — and more like a story worth telling.

“Don’t just analyze data. Let it talk.”
And that’s exactly what I tried to do.
